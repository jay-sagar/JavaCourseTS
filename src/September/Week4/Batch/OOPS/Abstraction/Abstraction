hiding the details and only showing the essential data is called abstraction,
there are two ways to achieve the abstraction in java,
 1: abstract class
 2: interface

 A class extends a another class
 A interface extends a another interface
 A class implements a another interface

 1: If you declare any class with abstract then it is called the abstract class
    It is 0% to 100% abstraction
    Can't create obj of abstraction

it can be used with class and method
It can't be instantiated
It can have constructor and static method also
it can have final method

2: interface is a blueprint of class => according to java 1.7
    100% abstraction
    we can't instantiate
    it don't contains constructor


# Pattern Design
1. Factory Design pattern
2. Adaptor Design pattern
3. Singleton Design pattern
